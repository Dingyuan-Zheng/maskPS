This repository contains the datasets we used in our paper "Segmentation Mask Guided End-to-End Person Search"

Signal Processing: Image Communication (Articles in press)

Our work is based on [OIM](https://github.com/ShuangLI59/person_search), [Faster R-CNN](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch) and [Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark).

## PRW Dataset
The mask annotations for the selected 495 images from [PRW](https://pan.baidu.com/s/16G7ewFICegRRBBp5En69MQ) dataset can be found here, the fetch code is `yt5i`.

## CUHK-SYSU Dataset
The mask annotations for the selected 1,833 images from [CHUK-SYSU](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1e4_Lsz7tCrUYBDIWYn0mUA) dataset can be found here, the fetch code is `sd27`.
